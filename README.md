start by running the firmware upgrader it will ask for a code. check the file that says "code.tx". It will be in there. 

Next open up folder 2 that says "runtime" there will be an exe for AseeVR setup.exe run that exe to install it to your computer. this will install all libs and data necessary to make it more accurate

after that, make sure to run the AMCap that comes with the files on the top right you will see the words “capture” click that, and in the drop down click “Set Frame Rate”

set your frame rate to look like mine. it should say “10000” and the “Use Frame Rate” box should be checked.
